# Concatenation of Tuples
# Tuples can be concatenated using the + operator. This operation combines two or more tuples to create a new tuple.

# Note- Only the same datatypes can be combined with concatenation, an error arises if a list and a tuple are combined. 

tup1 = ("Hello", "Hello")
tup2 = (1, 2,3)

tup3  = tup1 + tup2
print(tup3)
